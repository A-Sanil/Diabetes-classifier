# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Aim
The aim of this project is to predict whether a person is diabetic based on clinical and demographic features using various supervised machine learning models. The dataset is derived from real patient data including age, BMI, blood glucose, and other vital metrics.

Using KNN,Naive Bayes, Extra Trees Classifier
## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 🧪 Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Run the following command in your terminal to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


```

💡 Future Work
Integrate SVM model into predictions

Add a GUI using Streamlit

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
